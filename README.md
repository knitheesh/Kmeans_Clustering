#  Project Title :
 
Analysis and Prediction of "Mall_Customers.csv" of phonix small to find out how many customers are visited to a particular shop. On the basis of this prediction of annual income vs spending scores.


# Problem statement

The american finance market as per the GDP of 2011 'phonix_trillums' are as the first range out of five.

The owner wants to be exact particular shop or products search in different kind of clusters in a entire mall.

As a datascience engineer predict the feturestic financial market for upcomming GDP rate based on number of clusters.
the client wants atleast to five clusters [shops] 

## Conclusion :

According to the Model basics prediction using Machine Learning KMeans clustering we foud that cluster which consist Red color is the highest color which attach more then 50 computers.

## Disclamer

In this prticular dataset we assume annual income as centroid and spending score from the range 1 to 100  called as datanodes of the cluster 

## References :

The model building algorithm develop for all kinds of clusteration values.The yelllow spots represents centroids which max is 3
